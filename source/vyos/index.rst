VyOS
====

VyOS is an open source network operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux.

VyOS provides a free routing platform that competes directly with other commercially available solutions from well known network providers. Because VyOS runs on standard amd64, i586 and ARM systems, it is able to be used as a router and firewall platform for cloud deployments. It is based on the Debian Linux distribution and includes a wide range of networking tools and protocols such as BGP, OSPF, VRRP, QoS, NAT, and VPN. VyOS is designed to be installed on hardware or virtual machines and can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of an organization.

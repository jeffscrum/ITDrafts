Send files to Amazon Kindle
===========================

Method 1
--------

To transfer files to Kindle, we recommend using our wireless Send-to-Kindle service (`Send to Kindle <https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle>`_), which can securely transfer files up to 200 MB each.

Supported file types include: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, HTM, HTML, PNG, GIF, JPG, JPEG, BMP, EPUB.


Method 2
--------

So, you can send epubs from the Send to Kindle way, like an email which you find in your kindle Settings Menu > Account > Email Send to Kindle, you copy that address, go to your active email account that you have enabled from amazon.

But then I ran into this issue where my gmail wouldn't let me send any file bigger than 25 MB and then it was somewhat crazy with so many answers online and I couldn't get to work the one with that requires USB connection (the file just wouldn't show up!! an .epub actually), I know that for many long term users, this might be somewhat stupid, but for new ones to Kindle, I offer this solution:

1. Send file to Google Drive (in your PC)
2. Select that file in Drive (from mobile device its easier iphone or android), choose "Send a Copy"
3. Select Kindle app icon
4. Fill the author's name space
5. Send it and, it will eventually show up in your Kindle's library

The files supported for this one, are as they show on Amazon site: Microsoft Word (.DOC, .DOCX) HTML (.HTML, HTM) RTF (.RTF) Text (.TXT) JPEG (.JPEG, .JPG) GIF (.GIF) PNG (.PNG) BMP (.BMP) PDF (.PDF) EPUB (.EPUB)

So, if your file is smaller than 25 or 50 MB (hotmail lets you send bigger files than gmail), go with the Send to Kindle email route

If it is bigger, then use your Google Drive!!

Citus Utility Functions
=======================

This section contains reference information for the User Defined Functions provided by Citus. These functions help in providing additional distributed functionality to Citus other than the standard SQL commands.

Table and Shard DDL
-------------------
.. _create_distributed_table:

create_distributed_table
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The create_distributed_table() function is used to define a distributed table
and create its shards if it's a hash-distributed table. This function takes in
a table name, the distribution column and an optional distribution method and
inserts appropriate metadata to mark the table as distributed. The function
defaults to 'hash' distribution if no distribution method is specified. If the
table is hash-distributed, the function also creates worker shards based on the
shard count configuration value. If the table contains any rows, they are
automatically distributed to worker nodes.

Arguments
************************

**table_name:** Name of the table which needs to be distributed.

**distribution_column:** The column on which the table is to be distributed.
